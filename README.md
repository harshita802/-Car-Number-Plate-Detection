# -Car-Number-Plate-Detection
## Overview
This repository provides an implementation of Car Number Plate Detection using Tesseract OCR. The system detects and extracts number plate information from images, making it a valuable tool for applications such as traffic monitoring, parking management, and law enforcement.

## Features
### Image Processing: The system utilizes image processing techniques to identify and isolate car number plates within an image.

### Tesseract OCR: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is performed using Tesseract, an open-source OCR engine. Tesseract extracts text data from the identified number plates.

### Accuracy and Flexibility: The combination of image processing and Tesseract OCR ensures accurate and flexible detection, even in varying lighting and environmental conditions.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

## Dependencies: 
Tesseract OCR , pytesseract 
## Customization
### Parameter Tuning: Adjust image processing parameters in car_plate_detection.py for optimal results based on your specific use case.

## Integration: Integrate the code into your existing projects or systems that require car number plate detection.
